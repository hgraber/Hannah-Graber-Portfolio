# Visualizing Government Debt

The following visualizations explore the debt-to-GDP ratios for governments across the worldâ€”that is, the gross debt of a country as a percentage of their GDP. The data used to produce the charts in this section come from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) from their National Accounts at a Glance data. In this case, government debt includes currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. 

First, let's get a sense of the countries' relative debt standing for 2019 for snapshot of their financial wellbeing.
