# Visualizing Government Debt

The following visualizations explore the debt-to-GDP ratios for governments across the worldâ€”that is, the gross debt of a country as a percentage of their GDP. The data used to produce the charts in this section come from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) from their National Accounts at a Glance data. In this case, government debt includes currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. 

First, let's get a sense of the countries' relative debt standing for 2019 for snapshot of their financial wellbeing.

SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE BAR CHART--WHO IS THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST? MENTION COMPARISON POINT AT THE AVERAGE

The next visualization represents average debt-to-GDP ratios for OECD for all countries from 1995 to 2021. Instead of data from only one year like in the previous bar chart, this graphic makes it possible to see all countries at one time. Notice at the end of each country's line, there is a point larger than the rest that represents the given country's most recent debt-to-GDP ratio for 2021.

SAY SOMETHING--HEPLFUL TO SEE ALL AT ONCE, BUT OVERWHELMING? TOO MUCH INFO? HARD TO GET DETAILED INFORMATION AB ACTUAL RATIOS-SO SMALL

Finally--race
