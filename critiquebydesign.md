intro here

### Original Data Visualization

### Redesign 1
what I tried to do with this one--focus on one element: cost. thats what schools can potentially impact

- Can you describe what this visualization is telling you?

   **User 1:** This visualization is a breakdown of the prominence of what prevents students (or schools?) from accessing the internet.  
   **User 2:**  Cost is a significant factor among all types of schools in accessing internet.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

   **User 1:** I can't tell if the x-axis and data labels are referring to students or schools--seems conflicting and that's unclear to me. Are the schools trying to get access? Or people who ATTEND the schools trying to get access?     
   **User 2:** I'm taken aback by the large amount of rural high needs schools for whom availability is an issue. Why isn't that data highlighted? I'm curious about it but left with questions. Also, I'm not totally understanding what the labels on the x-axis mean; what defines a 'low needs' school?

- Based on the data represented here, who do you think is the intended audience?

   **User 1:** Ideally, people who have the power to allocate funding to schools and/or students or internet service providers who are price-gouging subscription costs.   
   **User 2:** School administrators and teachers/staff who are trying to learn more about the demography of their district--and the differences between each 'type' of school.

- What would you change about this visualization, if anything?

   **User 1:** I would change the labels on the x-axis to be more clear for the population you're trying to represent (schools or students at the schools), keep percentage signs on all data labels (because the percentages don't add up to 100 so I think you need them), and find a way to represent high needs schools together and THEN disaggregate by urban and rural. Does it make sense to represent high needs schools together and then have a separate visulization breaking down how high needs schools differ by urban and rural?  
   **User 2:** I would make the title and categories of schools more clear, but I'm not really sure how to do that. I think you could mention in the title that the population of interest is students in these schools, and then amend the school category labels to reflect the change in the title. I think the green for the cost could be a little brighter because it seems like the dark gray and dark green are almost of the same significance.
