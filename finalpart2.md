## Final Project, Part 2

### Storyboards
Below are storyboards that represent a visual walk-through of the primary elements of my outline from part 1, tying in my updated sketches to illustrate how I intend to lead the reader through my story. NOTE: I accidentally mislabeled the 'slides' and so there is no slide 3 present. The order of the slides in this storyboard is as intended.

### User research and interviews
**What I hope to learn**  
In the user interviews, I hope to learn more about the flow of the story and the amount of information presented. I struggled with what information to provide when in the storyboard and moved information around as I worked on it, so I’m curious to hear others’ perspective on if they had their questions answered as data was presented, or if they were left feeling like the information didn’t flow like they hoped it would. The story of broadband access is complex—and I feel very passionately about it—so I am wondering if the information provided paints too complicated a picture of what’s going on with too much, or too disparate, data. 

**Target audience**  
My target audience for this story is the general public, specifically geared towards those living in Pennsylvania and who care about communities’ equitable access to resources. The ‘call to action’ entails contacting a state representative and conducting speed test data on their devices; Neither of these actions are particular to policymakers or government officials, though the story would be relevant to them, as well. As such, I chose to find three users of different demography (age, gender, MSA status) to try and represent the ‘general public’ as much as possible.

**Interview script**  
*Introduction*
Hello! Thank you for agreeing to help me with my class assignment. I’m really excited to show you what I’ve been learning. After looking at the following storyboard, I’m going to ask you some questions about what you think about the story presented.

*Questions*
* Can you describe your key takeaways from the story presented in your own words?  
* Based on the data represented here, who do you think is the intended audience?  
* What would you change about this story, if anything (e.g., order of information, less information, more information, different visualizations, etc.)?  
* What questions do you still have about this story, if any?  

*Wrap up*  
Thank you so much for your time—I really appreciate your input and effort to help me out. Do you have any more questions for me?
