## Final Project, Part 3 (woohoo!)

### My process thus far 
#### The beginning ([Part 1](/finalpart1.md))
From the start of idea conception for this project, I knew I wanted to focus on broadband, but the scope became more narrow in some aspects and broader in others. 

First, I wanted the focus of my project to be a call for better *data* as it relates to broadband speed and access. I created a one sentence summary of what I wanted to convey in the project, what I wanted my audience to takeaway, and what I wanted my audience to do:

Using the principles of story design from our textbook, 'Good Charts Workbook: Tips, Tools, and Exercises for Making Better Data Visualizations' by Scott Berinato, I started by sketching out a visual "setup," "conflict," and "resolution" based on the one-sentence summary and hopes for my audience:

From this initial sketching, I tried to break the visualizations out and develop them further. As you can see from the maps, I started out thinking I was only going to focus on broadband data in Allegheny County, PA rather than the whole state.

In retrospect, my ideas for visualization and calls to action remained the same throughout the project with the change of narrowing the scope of the issue (from better data to increasing broadband speed definitions) and broadening the geography of focus (all of PA instead of only Allegheny County).  

If I'm being honest, I felt quite unsure about where my data was going to come from. I have worked with the U.S. Census ACS before and knew I could find information about broadband access there, but the other sources of information were fuzzy. In the end, I used most of the data sources I originally identified, exclusing the Ookla public speedtest data as I ran into issues downloading the data and finding a way to incorporate it into my project. I used the following data sources for my project as I started building out the visualizations in Tableau and Flourish:

* [ACS 1-year 2021 Internet and Broadband Access Data (B28011)](https://data.census.gov/table?q=B28011:+INTERNET+SUBSCRIPTIONS+IN+HOUSEHOLD)
* [Ookla Speedtesting](https://www.speedtest.net/)
* [Broadband and the Wisconsin Economy](https://economicdevelopment.extension.wisc.edu/files/2021/06/2021-01-07-Broadband-Report.pdf)



#### The middle ([Part 2](/finalpart2.md))

In my next sketches and initial renderings of my visualizations in Flourish, you can see the changes in scope as I attempt to make my message more streamlined. I still mention better data collection--but only briefly--and moved from Allegheny County to all of PA. Here is my initial outlining of the journey I imagined:

And here is the fleshed out storyboard I created from the outline:

From the storyboard, I asked three users to tell me their thoughts on their main takeaways, the intended audience, what they'd change, and any questions still remaining. I received some very helpful feedback that I considered as I moved forward in the project process. Across all interviews, the users' perspective of my intended audience differed. From these observations, I decided that my audience is still 'general layperson' in tone and jargon, but the specific examples I use can be tailored to the group I'm speaking to. In this instance, I'm speaking to people who are sitting in Hamburg Hall, but not necessarily *policy students* sitting in Hamburg Hall. Additionally, it was clear I needed to make the pixels graphs more consistent and easy to understand and I finally figured out how to implement my idea in Tableau with minor complications. Finally, I did consider adding an additional visualization exploring other states whose definition of broadband is different than the national 25/3 Mbps definition to appease questions about PA's strange standard, but the data was very incomplete and contradictory so I decided against it.
