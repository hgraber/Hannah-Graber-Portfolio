## Hannah Graber Telling Stories with Data Portfolio

# About me 
Hey y'all! I'm Hannah (she/her): a self-proclaimed digital equity aficionado with an affinity for sustainable community development and workforce programming. I am currently based in Pittsburgh, PA where I'm pursuing my Masters degree in Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon. My academic interests lie at the intersection of smart cities, communtiy development, and policy analysis. I am striving to learn how to lift communities with evidence-based recommendations, advanced technology, and data.

*Here's me:*

# What I hope to learn
This past summer, I was lucky enough to work at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland in the Community Development department where I delved into broadband and digital equity research in areas of Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky. I realized that after the data cleaning and analysis phase, I was at a loss for how to effectively comunicate my findings visually. In this course, I hope to learn more about the principles of effective data visualization design, tools for creating visualizations like Tableau, and finallyâ€”to create a publicly accessible portfolio of work (featured here!).

Once I graduate, I hope to work in policy research at a think tank or non-profit. Hopefully, I'll be able to utilize my skills in programming, database management, and data visualization to make change at a systemic level in the United States.
